This is my solution to the RPG Combat kata-coding (you can find the PDF into the repository).
This solution has been implemented by using two famous design patterns:
+ Decorator pattern: used to distinguish different type of characters;
+ Chain responsibility: used to ease the sequence of checks supposed to be executed

This solution is just a demo, it can be improved and any advice is very welcome!
