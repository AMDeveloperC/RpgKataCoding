This is my solution to the [rpg kata coding](https://github.com/ardalis/kata-catalog/blob/main/katas/RPG%20Combat.md).

This kata coding has been proposed for a coding interview.

This solution has been implemented by using two famous design patterns:
+ Decorator pattern: used to distinguish different type of characters;
+ Chain responsibility: used to ease the sequence of checks supposed to be executed

This solution is just a demo, it can be improved and any advice is the very welcome!
